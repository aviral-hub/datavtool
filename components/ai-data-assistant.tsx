        "Missing data means some cells in your spreadsheet are empty or contain no information. Think of it like having blank spaces in a form - you can't make complete decisions without all the information.",
      businessImpact:
        "Missing data can lead to incomplete analysis and wrong business decisions. For example, if customer ages are missing, you can't properly target marketing campaigns.",
      commonCauses: [
        "People skipped fields when filling out forms",

      businessImpact:
        "Duplicates can inflate your numbers, making you think you have more customers than you actually do. They also waste storage space and can cause confusion in reports.",
      commonCauses: [

        "Keep the most recent or most complete version of duplicate records",

        "Set up duplicate checking before saving new records",
        "Schedule regular database cleanup and maintenance",
        "Train staff on proper data entry procedures",

    outliers: {
      title: "Unusual Values (Outliers)",
      explanation:
        "Outliers are like finding a 200-year-old person in your customer database - values that are much higher or lower than what you'd normally expect. They stand out from the crowd.",
      businessImpact:
        "Outliers can indicate data entry errors, fraud, or genuinely special cases that need attention. They can also skew your analysis and make averages misleading.",
      commonCauses: [
        "Data entry mistakes (like typing an extra zero: $1000 becomes $10000)",
        "Using wrong units (entering feet instead of inches)",

        "Sales: $1,000,000 order when typical orders are $100 (could be error or major client)",
        "Age: 150-year-old customer (likely data entry error)",
        "Inventory: -500 items in stock (system error, can't have negative inventory)",

      ],
    },
    formatting: {
      title: "Inconsistent Formatting",
      explanation:
        "Formatting issues are like having some addresses written as '123 Main St' and others as '123 MAIN STREET' - the same information written in different ways, making it hard to work with.",
      businessImpact:
        "Poor formatting makes data hard to analyze and can cause errors in reports. It's like trying to organize a filing cabinet where everyone uses different filing systems.",
      commonCauses: [
        "Different people entering data in their own style",

      businessImpact:
        "Invalid data leads to wrong conclusions and poor business decisions. It's like trying to navigate with a broken compass - you'll end up going in the wrong direction.",

    what_is_data_quality:
      "Data quality is like the cleanliness and organization of your workspace. Just as a clean, organized desk helps you work more efficiently and find things quickly, high-quality data helps you make better business decisions and get accurate insights. It means your data is accurate (correct), complete (not missing important information), consistent (formatted the same way), and up-to-date (current and relevant).",

    why_does_data_quality_matter:
      "Data quality directly impacts your business success. Poor quality data leads to wrong decisions, wasted money, missed opportunities, and lost customers. For example, if customer addresses are wrong, you can't deliver products. If sales data has errors, you might make poor inventory decisions. Good data quality gives you confidence in your analysis and helps you make smart business choices.",

    how_long_does_cleaning_take:
      "Data cleaning time depends on your data size and quality. For small datasets (under 1,000 rows), basic cleaning might take 30 minutes to 2 hours. Larger datasets or those with many issues could take several days. However, the time invested in cleaning pays off through better decision-making and fewer problems later.",

    what_should_i_fix_first:
      "Start with issues that have the biggest business impact: 1) Missing critical information (like customer contact details), 2) Obvious errors (like negative prices or future birth dates), 3) Duplicates that inflate your numbers, 4) Formatting issues that prevent analysis. Focus on data you use most frequently for important decisions.",

    how_do_i_prevent_future_problems:
      "Prevention is much easier than fixing problems later. Set up validation rules in your data entry systems, train your team on proper data entry, use dropdown menus instead of free text when possible, and schedule regular data quality checks. Think of it like maintaining your car - regular maintenance prevents expensive repairs.",

    what_if_i_delete_important_data:
      "Always make a backup copy of your original data before making any changes. Most data cleaning tools allow you to preview changes before applying them. Start with small, safe changes and gradually work up to more complex fixes. When in doubt, flag questionable data for review rather than deleting it immediately.",
